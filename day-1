2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
 ans: An object, is a reference data type.
 In JavaScript, an object is an entity, with properties and type.
 an object define the characteristics of the object.
 objectName.propertyName......> To access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation
 For example
   my car is an object
   properties taken like model,make,year.
   const myCar = new Object();
   myCar.make = 'Ford';
   myCar.model = 'Mustang';
   myCar.year = 1969;
   object initializer
   const myCar = {
  make: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  year: 1969
};
Unassigned properties of an object are undefined (and not null).
access the properties of the myCar object as follows:
myCar['make'] = 'maruthi';
myCar['model'] = 'alto';
myCar['year'] = 2016;
